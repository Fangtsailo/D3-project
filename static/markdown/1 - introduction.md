# Vue and D3 Workshop

## Introduction

### Hello! My name is Jon Snyder

I am the on the Front End UX Team over at
[One Discovery](http://www.onediscovery.com). We create eDiscovery Software for
law firms. The main focus is to provide insight into their data, as well as
managing it.

It can get complex. Each case is different, making data exploration an important
aspect of this job.

## Data Visualization

Data is _the_ basic building block of analytical exploration. It tells a story,
in an infinite amount of ways. But how do we read the story? How do we choose
what chapters to focus on, and where to look for clues?

In a neverending cycle of trying to interpret data, we need a way in which to
_try_ and see the data from different perspectives.

## Interfaces

> "_The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never
> expected to see._"

We have this amazing thing called vision. and out of all our senses, it's the
most abundant in collecting data, giving us a better view of the world around
us. However it opens doors for entirely new ways of understanding, which in
return can open even more doors when combining parts of this spectrum.

Having an interface that leverages these particular dimensions not only gives us
insight from a viewing perspective, but also allows for navigation into the data
that is being shown.
