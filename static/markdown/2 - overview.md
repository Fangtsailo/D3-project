# Workshop

## Overview
In this workshop we will be covering the following sections:

- [Vue and D3 Overview](#vue-and-d3)
- [Working with Shapes - Lines](#d3-line)
- [Working with Shapes - Arcs](#d3-arc-and-d3-pie)

## Vue and D3

Vue and D3 complement each other on various principles. In this excercise we will leverage Vue's `reactive state` while using `D3-Scale`


## D3-Line

In this excercise, we will explore `D3-Shape` and how it works along side of Vue's `Template Syntax`.
We will go a bit into depth on animating and styling the SVG output, as well as implementing user interaction

## D3-Arc and D3-Pie

One unique feature that Vue provides is it's way to `nest components`. Since SVG's are considered DOM markup, we can manage our visuals to follow the same pattern. We will be creating `Arc components`, and then nesting them inside of a `Pie chart component`.
