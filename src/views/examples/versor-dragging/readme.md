# Versor Dragging

This is from
[Mike Bostock's example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1e10b76becaa4ea4471262bcae619dae)

There are many different projections we can provide, each with it's own way of
using versor.

These include:

- geoAzimuthalEquidistant
- geoAzimuthalEqualArea
- geoGnomonic
- geoOrthographic
- geoStereographic
- geoConicConformal
- geoConicEqualArea
- geoConicEquidistant
- geoEquirectangular
- geoMercator
- geoTransverseMercator

By changing this value, we can depict a new 2d projection, with our mouse x,y
values mapped
