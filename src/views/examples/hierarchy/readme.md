# Visualizing Hierarchies

This example shows a couple of ways that we can visualize a nested tree-like
structure.

In this example, we are providing a dataset of nested children, representing
folders. Each folder has a value that represents the size of that individual
folder.

This is only one type of example, however there are alot of ways we can use a
hierarchy to determine other useful data displays, such as a
[word tree](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/?source=cat-in-the-hat.txt&prefix=Thing&reverse=0&phrase-line=0)
