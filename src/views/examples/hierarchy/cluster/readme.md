# Cluster Layout

The **cluster layout** produces
[dendrograms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram): node-link diagrams that
place leaf nodes of the tree at the same depth. Dendograms are typically less
compact than [tidy trees](#/demos/hierarchy/tree), but are useful when all the leaves should be
at the same level, such as for hierarchical clustering or
[phylogenetic tree diagrams](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c034d66572fd6bd6815a).
