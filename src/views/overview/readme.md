# Overview

This is an overview of how these two libraries work together

## Vue

Vue (pronounced `/vjuÀê/`, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building
user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally
adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on
different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on
the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you
tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

### Reactivity

Unline imperitive programming, this way of programming gives is enormous
benefits. Mike Bostock explained this perfectly in his
[recent keynote](https://youtu.be/aT4JvF7sglg?t=8m53s). When you have a reactive
system, you spend less time needing to re-evaluate calculations, and more time
managing the current state of things, while calculations are done for you.

#### Quick Example

```js
var a = 1

var b = 2

var c = a + b // 3
```

Now, if we change the value of `a` or `b`, does the value of `c` change? no, no
it does not. Bummer...

But when things are _reactive_, this evaluation can be done for you
automagically.

### SVG Template Rendering

Vue has a pretty cool way of rendering templated content. Instead of only
allowing render functions that are placed within code, Vue offers template
syntax that's almost indistinguishable from regular dom elements. In fact, a
template can consist of just html, and Vue will handle it without a problem.

### Interactivity

Because of the nature in which Vue handles event listeners, we can utilize it's
templating system to give us a clearer image of what is looking for user
interaction. And because D3 has many utoilities surrounding SVG elements, Vue
gives us a way to instantly manage the interactions.

### Ease of Use

Vue is not the only library out there that can do this. However, I feel that the
amount of time it takes to actually create a reactive environment, that can
leverage SVG elements and the nesting of them, gives Vue a leg up in this
regard.

## D3

Elijah Meeks wrote an article recently titled
[D3 is not a Data Visualization Library](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/d3-is-not-a-data-visualization-library-67ba549e8520),
and it is such a perfect definition. D3 is _not_ a library for making charts.
Think of D3 as a toolbox of utilities that can you can use to help produce
charts, or xenographics, or really cool interactive stuff.

### What D3 is made out of

- Dataviz / Geographical
- Animation
- Analysis
- Data Utilities (Lodash-y stuff)
- DOM Utilities (jQuery-ish stuff)

### What Vue Replaces

We are not required to use all of these libraries together. If Lodash is more your style, feel free. I personally like chroma.js for color transformation for example. However, Vue can completely take over everything that D3's DOM manipulation can do. And when you combine that with reactivity, your data comes to life.
