# UX Principles as Algorithms

There is a law in UX called `Fitts's Law`. This law states that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

To actually be able to evaulate this as an equation, means that we can tie together these rules. Mike Bostock told a brilliant explanation of how he managed to use Voronoi Overlays to performthis in a [Working Example](http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/airports.html)
