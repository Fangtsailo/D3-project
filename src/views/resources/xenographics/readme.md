## Xenographics

Xeno.graphics is a collection of unusual charts and maps, managed by
[Maarten Lambrechts](http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/). Its objective is to
create a repository of novel, innovative and experimental visualizations to
inspire you, to fight xenographphobia and popularize new chart types.

The xenographics collection will keep on growing. If you know of one that isnâ€™t
here already, please [submit it](http://xeno.graphics/submit/). You can also
expect some posts about certain topics around xenographics.
