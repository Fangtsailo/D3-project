# Semiology of Graphics

**Jacques Bertin** (27 July 1918 – 3 May 2010) was a French
[cartographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographer 'Cartographer') and
theorist, known from his book _Semiologie Graphique_ ( _Semiology of Graphics_),
published in 1967. This monumental work, based on his experience as a
cartographer and geographer, represents the first and widest intent to provide a
theoretical foundation to
[Information Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Visualization 'Information Visualization').

We typically think of dimensions as spatial and quantitative, such as a position
in space represented by real numbers ⟨_x, y, z_⟩. Yet with abstract data there
are also non-quantitative dimensions; for example, diamond cut quality (fair,
good, very good, ideal) is ordinal, while diamond cut shape (princess, round,
marquise, _etc._) is categorical.

A systematic classification of the use of visual elements to display data and
relationships, primarily in static graphics. Bertin's system consisted of seven
visual variables: position, form (shape), orientation, color (hue), texture,
value (lightness or darkness of color), and size, combined with a visual
semantics for linking data attributes to visual elements.

> Within the plane a mark can be at the top or the bottom, to the right or the
> left. The eye perceives two independent dimensions along X and Y, which are
> distinguished orthogonally. A variation in light energy produces a third
> dimension in Z, which is independent of X and Y…

> The eye is sensitive, along the Z dimension, to 6 independent visual
> variables, which can be superimposed on the planar figures: the size of the
> marks, their value, texture, color, orientation, and shape. They can represent
> differences (≠), similarities (≡), a quantified order (Q), or a nonquantified
> order (O), and can express groups, hierarchies, or vertical movements.
